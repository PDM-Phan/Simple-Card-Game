# Simple-Card-Game
**As the name implies, this is a Simple Card Game.**

Made out of the pure creativity of PDM-Phan, this Python3 code is entirely original and dedicated to improve my coding skills.

## How the game works:
  1 - Each player receives a card in turns until they have the same amount of them and theres no more cards to be given;

  2 - In each round they will compare their last cards, the higher value wins and both cards are put at the beginning of the winner list; 

  3 - The game will continue until one of the players has no more cards to play.

Simple as that, give it a try!
